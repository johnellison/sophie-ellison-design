      p Building a hand-made market stall out of old reclaimed floorboards, we held open design workshops every week for six months in order to engage the locals in the process of decision making and design. 

      p Pushing the boundaries of traditional architectural representation, we engaged the community through workshops, events, shadow storytelling, painting, film and we initiated meetings with diverse members of the community and developers. 

      p The market stall in itself offered nothing to sell, but rather gave people a space to exchange ideas. Whereas before, a disjointed communication led to the polarization of the community, this time, the open-mindedness of a participatory approach was bringing all members of the community together.
