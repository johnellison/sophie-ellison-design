      p.drop-cap In the middle of the Negev desert, Israel, I volunteered in the process of building a family of fourâ€™s straw-bale house, designed by Nava Beja. The regulation is Israel is such that a concrete bomb shelter must be constructed on the basement level, so only the upper level was straw bale. I was mainly involved in the clay and lime plastering of the house yet learnt about the entire structure simply by working within the exposed structure.
