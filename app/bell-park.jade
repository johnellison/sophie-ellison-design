      p.drop-cap  As a master’s of architecture project, the scope of this project was far larger than anything I had done before. The client was asking for accommodation for 300 students, a community centre, library, cafe, lecture hall and transit hub, all on a 7 acre site, in the centre of Denver, Colorado.  
      p The site, being right in the centre of Denver, was surrounded on all sides by noise, roads and large buildings. It’s beauty lay in the river that ran through it’s centre, something that sparked my idea for the following concept:
      aside.pull-quote
        blockquote
          p Out of the concrete desert... lies a luscious oasis. 
      p I figured it would be a breath of fresh air for the students after their busy days to take refuge in the quiet, green, urban oasis of Bell Park. I decided to focus my efforts on making the site as inviting, green and sheltered as I could, for where else in the city could you find peace?
      p As a result, the buildings are designed at the perimeter of the site, enabling a quiet, secluded garden, right at its centre. The landscape is split into four segments, each reflecting the program and activity of the adjacent buildings. 
      p The project images show some larger conceptual ideas, landscape plans, elevations, sections and a sectional model that focuses in on the library’s structure.
