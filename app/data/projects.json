The client required large student accommodation buildings, a library, cafe, community centre and transit hub. The site lies in the centre of Denver with it’s famous Cherry Creek river running right through it’s centre. The concept I worked with throughout was ‘out of the concrete desert...lies a luscious oasis’.",
